TASK 7: AI PROMPT ENGINEERING ANALYSIS

1. TECHNIQUE SELECTED:
One-Shot Prompting

2. PROGRAMMING TASK DEFINED:
Write a C function that checks if a person's age qualifies them as an adult (18 or older).

3. PROMPT AND AI RESPONSE:

MY PROMPT:
"Here's an example of a C function that checks if a number is positive:

int is_positive(int n)
{
    if (n > 0)
        return (1);
    return (0);
}

Now, following the same style, write a C function that checks if a number is above 18."

AI RESPONSE:
int is_adult(int n)
{
    if (n >= 18)
        return (1);
    return (0);
}

4. JUSTIFICATION (Why One-Shot Prompting):
One-shot prompting was the most appropriate technique for this task because providing a single example established the exact coding style I needed—simple if-statements with return values of 1 or 0. Without the example, the AI might have used different naming conventions or more complex logic. The pattern-matching from one clear example eliminated ambiguity and ensured consistency.

5. PRACTICAL APPLICATION REFLECTION:
In large software projects, one-shot prompting maintains coding consistency across teams by showing developers one canonical example to follow. When onboarding new team members or generating boilerplate code, providing a single well-written example is faster and clearer than writing lengthy style guides. This technique could automate repetitive function generation while keeping the entire codebase uniform in structure and readability.
